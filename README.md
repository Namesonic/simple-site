# Simple Site

This is a scaffolding project for the Simple Site Framework.

Build loosely around the Laravel Framework structure for familiarity, use this package
to build a simple html website application that utilizes a simple template feature.

## Features

- Lightweight MVC Structure (sans M)
- Multiple Layouts
- No CSS/js dependencies (install your own)
- Simple variable substitution handling for templates
- Configuration Handling (coming soon)
- Exception Handling

## Requires

- PHP 8.1 or greater

## Installation

Exchange `my-site-name` below with the folder name that will contain your new website.

`composer create-project namesonic/simple-site my-site-name`

If composer did not install any dependencies (missing the /vendor folder), or even if it did, you can run, `composer install` to double check.

## Configuration

For a production server, your webserver document root should be configured to point to `my-site-name/public` folder.

## Development

This package lays out the following directory structure meant to organize your code, layouts and display pages.

```
